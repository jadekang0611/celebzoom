# Project 1 Feedback

## Code Quality - Excelling

Criteria: Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

### Strengths:

-   Formatting is well done throughout, including spacing, indentations, and overall organization.
-   Variable names are semantic and sensible, and help the reader understand the purpose of the code.
-   Excellent use of comments to explain purpose and function of code.

### Areas for Growth:

-   A few minor inconsistencies in some JS files, such as mixed use of single and double quotes.
-   Mixed use of `let` and `const` for variable declarations in some files. In general, reserve `const` to signal when the variable value won't be reassigned, and `let` for when it will be reassigned.

## Technical Requirements - Excelling

Criteria: How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

### Strengths:

-   Project shows mastery of key concepts in HTML, CSS, and JS that were covered in Unit 1.
-   JS shows mastery of important themes such as DOM manipulation and functional programming.
-   Separation of concerns into multiple HTML, CSS and JS files.
-   Use of technology not covered in class, including Firebase and Material Design.
-   Use of Git Branches to manage feature development. Nice work here!

### Areas for Growth:

-   None at this time. :)

## Creativity and Interface - Excelling

Criteria: Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

### Strengths:

-   Modern, professional and uncluttered user interface.
-   Excellent use of a CSS framework to create an appealing design. Great choice of color palette as well.
-   Application functions well on small and large screens alike, though the user has to scroll down to answer when the screen is smaller.

### Areas for Growth

-   One small issue I had with the interface is that the text input area for the user's answer is a bit small, and I had problems clicking into it a few times.

## Functionality - Excelling

Criteria: Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

### Strengths:

-   The application works as a complete quiz, with several different options and randomized pictures.
-   All features are fully implemented, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
-   Great use of JS to create features that go above and beyond a simple trivia game, including modals, a timer, and evaluating the user's answer via text input rather than multiple choice.

### Areas for Growth:

-   One small bug I noticed while playing the game is that while switching to the next question, the question switches before the picture, and for a few milliseconds the previous image still shows.
-   Ten seconds is really short! I'd consider giving the user a little bit more time to answer the questions. :)

## Presentation - Performing

Criteria: Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

### Strengths:

-   Good coverage of planning process in your README, including wire-frames, obstacles during development, and future plans.
-   Repo is very well-organized, with CSS and JS files grouped together in their own directories.

### Areas for Growth:

-   There should be a link to your deployed game on your repo so that visitors to the repo can easily access the live site.
-   Is the `img` folder with the Johnny Depp image necessary, or a leftover from when you hard-coded the images?

## Hard Requirements - Complete:

-   [x] The project is deployed to GitHub Pages or a custom domain
-   [x] The application renders in the browser and runs without errors
-   [x] The repo has a README that adequately documents the project

## Grade: Pass

Overall excellent work, Jade! Super impressed that you created your own Firebase DB in order to keep your game scale-able and code manageable. The design is clean and professional, and the game itself is a great concept and very well executed! Thanks for all your hard work on this, and going above and beyond the basic requirements in so many ways.
