## Description

The user has 10 seconds to figure out who the celebrity is and must type in their answer and submit before the timer reaches 0. 10 questions will be shown before the game is over. Users receive 10 points per right answer.

## Technology

* HTML5, CSS & JavaScript
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Firebase
* Firestore
* Google Material Design


## Obstacles

* There were no good APIs that I could use for free that would have given me the properties I needed to develop this application. Because of that, I decided to build my own database to replicate what an API would have given me rather than creating the quiz objects with local resources. This provides more flexibility to add new quiz objects to my app with zero code changes required.

## Future development

* I would like to make my code clean with less duplicated functionality and with more functions that handle one thing and one thing only. This will make it easier for myself or other developers to make modifications and contribute to the game without trying to decipher my spaghetti code.
* I didn't have enough time to build my own API, so I will like to make an API for security purposes to expose only the objects that the application really needs as well as to allow others to use my API. This will clean up and tighten up my code.
* I will also like to switch to using Material layout instead of creating my own styles for consistency as well as for providing an optimized responsive UI.
* I will like to add the ability for users to allow users to view the application as well as accept input in both English and Korean. This will involve changes not only to my code but also to my API as well.
